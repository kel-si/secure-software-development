# Chapter 1. Security Basics

## Vulnerabilities
- can be intentional (ex: backdoor, logic bomb, etc.) or unintentional


### Reporting and Handing Vulnerabilities
- through a 'timed disclosure process' or 'coordinated disclosure'
- gives the software supplier a limited time ('embargo time') to fix, after which, the vulnerability will be publicly disclosed whether it is fixed or not
- software developers should make it easy for vulnerabilities to be reported
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) for tracking

### CVEs
- global dictionary of some publicly disclosed vulnerabilities
- 'CVE-year-arbitraryID'
- CVEs only assigned if someone requests an assignment from a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)
- CVEs intentionally limited in scope
- only for publicly released software
- not normally assigned for online services

### Top Kinds of Vulnerabilities
- [Common Weaknesses Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/) identifies different types
- [CWE Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/)
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [OWASP Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/)
- many of the top vulnerabilities remain constant over decades

## Value of Knowing Top Kinds of Vulnerabilities
- top vulnerabilities make up >=90% of all vulnerabilities
- practical to focus on identifying and managing most common kinds
- helps identify other kinds of vulnerabilities (makes you more sensitive / aware)
