# Chapter 1. Security Basics

## The Need for Risk Management
- manage risks before they become problems
- cannot eliminate all risk
- make it difficult for an attack to succeed and reduce the impact if an attack succeeds
- easier to design software to minimize risks than change it later
- do not wait for risks to become **_problems_**
- professional reputation, software's reputation, and organization's reputation

## Risk Management Process
- small projects with relatively low impacts can do informal risk management
- large projects with major impacts should be more rigorous

#### 1. Risk Planning
- determine risk management process

#### 2. Risk Identification
- what _might_ go wrong
- look at similar projects
- good idea to write a list down

#### 3. Risk Analysis
- determine individual risk scores (likelihood x severity)

#### 4. Risk Handling
- what is to be done for each risk
- can accept (monitored and communicated to its stakeholders)
- can avoid (make some change to eliminate likelihood)
- can transfer (get insurance or transfer to another component that assumes risk)
- can control (reduce risk to an acceptable level by reducing likelihood and / or impact)
- can monitor (evaluate risks over time)
- ensure developers know about common mistakes / vulnerabilities and how to avoid
- use tools and approaches designed to make vulnerabilities less likely
- use tools and reviews to catch mistakes and vulnerabilities
- harden the system

## Identifying Risks
- work to develop a slightly paranoid mindset
- constant low-level concern of the many risks
- when writing secure programs, paranoia is a virtue
- talk about risks and review plans with others
- continuously look for risks
- **security is a process, not a product**


## Checklists Are Not Security
- checklists, guidelines, and tips are aids and can be helpful
> There is no substitute for thinking.
