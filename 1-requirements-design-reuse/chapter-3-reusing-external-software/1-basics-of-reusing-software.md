# Chapter 3: Reusing External Software

## Basics of Reusing Software
- may include operating systems, container runtime, frameworks, libraries, extensions, plugins, etc.
- some consider selection of reused software part of design process
- others condider it as its own category (ex: supply chain)
- core system may be relatively secure but does not mean extensions are
- extensions need to be separately evaluated (ex: ext
ensions on VSCode)
- biggest risks are often from the extensions, including plug-ins, add-ons, themes, components, packages, etc.
