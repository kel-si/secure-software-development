# Chapter 3: Reusing External Software

## Updating Reused Software Components
1. use package managers, version control systems, build tools, and automated tests
2. only depend on documented interfaces and behaviour
3. expect to update software you use
4. do not modify OSS and create own 'local fork'; work with original upstream OSS project to get updates incorporated into official version
5. keep reused software up to date (becomes more difficult the further out of date)
6. monitor software versions for known vulnerabilities

## Updating How You Use Reused Software Components
- avoid / replace any uses of obsolete / deprecated components
- may be impossible to quickly update if vulnerability is later found
